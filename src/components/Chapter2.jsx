      <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
      <p>Through it all, I held on to my belief that there was a greater plan at work, that even in the face of adversity, there was a purpose to be fulfilled. I drew strength from my faith, finding solace in the knowledge that I was not alone in this struggle.  
The world may have seemed dark and uncertain, but I held on to the light within me. I embraced the challenges that came my way, knowing that they were opportunities for growth and a testament to my resilience.  
Little did I know that this was just the beginning of a journey that would test not only my faith but also my understanding of what it means to endure in the face of adversity.  
  
Hearing the news that evening, my wife prepared delicious food as always, it looked delicious but when I tried that, I could not taste it, until then no signs of anything, besides my employees telling me my mouth was drooping to one side, but they were painters, not doctors. Little did I know a stroke was just starting… I was feeling normal as lifting my arms talking and smiling, I went to bed that night and at 2:30 am I woke up with this weird need to take a shower again, very sick was it the Covid thing? Why am I feeling like that? On January 31st 2020 at 2:30 am I was having a stroke, I got tired when taking a bath and decided to lay down in the bathtub where I used to relax, the time I was there death was actually coming. Now think about this, I tried to stand up and was paralyzed! I tried to call my wife for help and I had no voice! Very scary, right?  Then somehow I whispered her name, “Sarah”, by a miracle she heard me and thankfully I forgot to lock the door, she came in, looked at me and said: “You are having a stroke!” as Portuguese is my native language I had no idea what a “stroke” was, she called the ambulance immediately. In a miraculous twist, my voice returned, and amidst all the chaos, there I was, urgently declaring, ‘I need underwear!’ In a world filled with worries, vanity unexpectedly took center stage. Imagine this: in the middle of the night at 2:30 am, a fashion emergency unfolds. A half-body sensation, Confidently showing off all his awesomeness, earns a VIP escort to the hospital, courtesy of our heroic firefighters! Suddenly, emergency services transform into a show, proving that even in your undies, you can steal the spotlight!  And just when I thought the drama was over, attempting to dress up brought a startling revelation – I was blind! Life’s unexpected twists, where every moment becomes a tale of resilience and style.
In the eerie silence of the night, my voice had vanished, stolen by the stroke that gripped me. As I lay there, whispering my wife’s name without a sound, a desperate plea lost in the stillness, The Lord was already working on my behalf. I didn’t know, my wife was in a  deep sleep, immersed in a  dream. Suddenly, the voice of many waters “Rev14:2” echoed in her dreams, a gentle push from the Lord Himself. Calling Her for help the voice urged. 

In that mysterious moment, Our special connection went beyond the quiet walls of our home. As my voiceless whispers reached out in the darkness, “Jesus woke her up in her dreams.  An urgent feeling that is not of this world, guiding her to my side. It was as if Angels guiding her  to save me, orchestrating a symphony of dreams and reality.

And so, she awoke, not to the mundane sounds of the night, but to the voice guiding her to my rescue. The miraculous fusion of dreams and reality unfolded as she rushed to my aid, guided by Him. In the silent drama of that night, the intervention became the lifeline that bridged the gap between despair and salvation.</p>
